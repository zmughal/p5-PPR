0.000005  Tue Jun 20 19:27:37 2017

    * Added missing PPR::X module
      (Thanks MST)


0.000006  Thu Jun 22 21:04:14 2017

    * Fixed documentation bug with slurp (pre-)example.
      (Thanks, Randal!)

    * Optimized matching of builtins slightly

    * Added $PPR::ERROR variable to assist error reporting on failure to match
      (Many thanks, MST!)



0.000007  Fri Jun 23 06:45:49 2017

    * Improved $PPR::ERROR API by adding origin location and diagnostics


0.000008  Sun Jun 25 15:24:13 2017

    * Unknotted POD nits.

    * Small optimizations to keyword and identifier recognition.

    * Fixed handling of multiline quotelikes that span heredoc contents.
      (Thanks Lukas)

    * SIGNIFICANT CHANGE: The $PPR::GRAMMAR variable now has to be
      interpolated at the start of any regex using it.

    * Fixed handling of layered heredocs (at the cost of having to install
      $PPR::GRAMMAR at the start of each grammar).
      (Thanks Lukas)

    * Fixed diamond operator parsing.
      (Thanks Lukas)


0.000009  Thu Jun 29 08:17:24 2017

    * SIGNIFICANT REVERSION: The $PPR::GRAMMAR variable no longer
      has to be interpolated at the start of any regex using it.
      Indeed, that placement is not recommended due to its effects
      on the numbering of positional captures within the main regex.

    * Fixed test files to allow testing under 5.10+, rather than 5.14+


0.000010  Fri Jul 14 07:36:47 2017

    * Added yada-yada (...) statement
      (Thanks, MST!)


0.000011  Fri Aug 11 17:52:14 2017

    * Further optimized parsing of heredocs

    * Eliminated even more repetition backtracking
      (bringing the grammar ever closer to DFA-osity)

    * Micro-optimization: Reordered PerlOWS and PerlNWS components to
      reflect that \n whitespace is more common that # comments or
      __END__ blocks

    * Made formats and heredocs play nice together by adding a potential
      heredoc skip at the end of the first line of a format.
      (Sincere thanks to Merijn)

    * Made interpolating quotelikes work (more) correctly.


0.000012  Mon Aug 21 20:40:08 2017

    * Handled /.../n flag
      (thanks, David)

    * Handled leading BOM correctly 
      (thanks, David)

    * Handled ${!}-style punctuation variables 
      (thanks, David)

    * "fline" is not a word (thanks, Hugo ;-)

    * Added (?&PerlEndOfLine)
      (Thanks, Yves)

    * Handled s/.../.../e behaviour better.
      Still not perfect, but perfection may not be possible using regexes.
      (Thanks, Aaron!)

    * Neutralized bizarre undefined warnings
      under earlier Perl versions.


0.000013  Mon Aug 21 20:54:42 2017

    * Removed spurious Regexp::Debugger dependency
      (Thanks Slaven!)
