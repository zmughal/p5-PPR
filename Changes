0.000001  Wed May 27 15:12:24 2015

    * Initial release.


0.000003  Tue Jun 20 06:05:22 2017

    * No changes logged


0.000005  Tue Jun 20 19:27:37 2017

    * Added missing PPR::X module
      (Thanks MST)


0.000006  Thu Jun 22 21:04:14 2017

    * Fixed documentation bug with slurp (pre-)example.
      (Thanks, Randal!)

    * Optimized matching of builtins slightly

    * Added $PPR::ERROR variable to assist error reporting on failure to match
      (Many thanks, MST!)



0.000007  Fri Jun 23 06:45:49 2017

    * Improved $PPR::ERROR API by adding origin location and diagnostics


0.000008  Sun Jun 25 15:24:13 2017

    * Unknotted POD nits.

    * Small optimizations to keyword and identifier recognition.

    * Fixed handling of multiline quotelikes that span heredoc contents.
      (Thanks Lukas)

    * SIGNIFICANT CHANGE: The $PPR::GRAMMAR variable now has to be
      interpolated at the start of any regex using it.

    * Fixed handling of layered heredocs (at the cost of having to install
      $PPR::GRAMMAR at the start of each grammar).
      (Thanks Lukas)

    * Fixed diamond operator parsing.
      (Thanks Lukas)


0.000009  Thu Jun 29 08:17:24 2017

    * SIGNIFICANT REVERSION: The $PPR::GRAMMAR variable no longer
      has to be interpolated at the start of any regex using it.
      Indeed, that placement is not recommended due to its effects
      on the numbering of positional captures within the main regex.

    * Fixed test files to allow testing under 5.10+, rather than 5.14+


0.000010  Fri Jul 14 07:36:47 2017

    * Added yada-yada (...) statement
      (Thanks, MST!)


0.000011  Fri Aug 11 17:52:14 2017

    * Further optimized parsing of heredocs

    * Eliminated even more repetition backtracking
      (bringing the grammar ever closer to DFA-osity)

    * Micro-optimization: Reordered PerlOWS and PerlNWS components to
      reflect that \n whitespace is more common that # comments or
      __END__ blocks

    * Made formats and heredocs play nice together by adding a potential
      heredoc skip at the end of the first line of a format.
      (Sincere thanks to Merijn)

    * Made interpolating quotelikes work (more) correctly.


0.000012  Mon Aug 21 20:40:08 2017

    * Handled /.../n flag
      (thanks, David)

    * Handled leading BOM correctly
      (thanks, David)

    * Handled ${!}-style punctuation variables
      (thanks, David)

    * "fline" is not a word (thanks, Hugo ;-)

    * Added (?&PerlEndOfLine)
      (Thanks, Yves)

    * Handled s/.../.../e behaviour better.
      Still not perfect, but perfection may not be possible using regexes.
      (Thanks, Aaron!)

    * Neutralized bizarre undefined warnings
      under earlier Perl versions.


0.000013  Mon Aug 21 20:54:42 2017

    * Removed spurious Regexp::Debugger dependency
      (Thanks Slaven!)


0.000014  Thu Sep 28 21:43:51 2017

    * Added BAIL_OUTs to test suite to accelerate
      and clarify testing under Perl 5.20

    * Added missing optional whitespace to DESTROY and AUTOLOAD declarations
      (thanks, Hauke D)


0.000015  Wed Dec  6 08:18:09 2017

    * Fixed disapproval.t test
      (Thanks, Martin!)

    * Fixed handling of ->$*, ->@*, and ->%*
      (Thanks, Curtis!)


0.000016  Mon Jun  4 13:58:06 2018

    * Uninlined optimizations in PPR::X to make redeclaration
      of subrules easier and more reliable.
      (Thanks, Matt!)

    * Added (?&PerlReturnExpression) to distinguish
      in-term usages from statement-level usages
      requiring (?&PerlReturnStatement)


0.000017  Tue Jun 19 07:57:57 2018

    * Added PPR::decomment()
      (mostly as an example of technique)

    * Updated for loop parsing to support explicitly aliased iterator variables
      (including arrays and hashes)

    * Added (?&PerlTermPostfixDereference) to simply PPR::X overloading of terms

    * Added Perl 5.28 ":attributes(before) ($ignature)" syntax for subroutines
      (thanks, Matt)


0.000018  Mon Jun 25 09:59:36 2018

    * Fixed _uniq()
      (thanks Adriano!)


0.000019  Tue Jun 26 19:33:17 2018

    * Fixed parsing of multiple POD sections
      (thanks Adriano!)


0.000020  Tue Jun 26 19:54:42 2018

    * Oops, fixed decomment() too.

    * Updates PPR::X approriately as well.



0.000021  Wed Jun 27 06:33:51 2018

    * Removed spurious Regexp::Debugger dependency
      (thanks, Adriano)

    * Fixed edge case on POD/whitespace parsing
      (thanks, Adriano)
